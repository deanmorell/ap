# Hello, world!

Welcome to Gulliver's Computer Science Principles Class! This class is modeled after CS50, Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming for students in high school.  In addition to learning concepts contained in the CS50 modules, you will learn to construct knowledge and have opportunities to practice skills in real-world scenarios that will better prepare you for the fast-paced, techno-centric world that you're a part of - skills such as effective public speaking; ability to work collaboratively with people of different skills and socio-economic and cultural backgrounds; entrepreneurship; and critical (problem-solving) thinking skills.  I'm looking forward to working with you as you develop the programming skills needed to follow your passion and engage in service learning projects that will help make Gulliver and our community a better place.
